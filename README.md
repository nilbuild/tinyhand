## Install

Open `TinyHand.dmg`, drag TinyHand to Applications and allow **Accessibility** when asked. It needs that to turn your clicks into taps. TinyHand updates itself.

## Use

| | |
|---|---|
| Click the menu bar icon, or **⌃⌥H** | Turn the pointer on or off |
| Right-click the menu bar icon | Menu and Settings |
| Click | Tap (nothing underneath gets clicked) |
| Hold and drag | Draw on the screen |
| **⌃⌥X** | Clear the drawing |
| **Esc** | Clear everything and turn the pointer off |

While the pointer is on, a small toolbar at the bottom of the screen lets you pick one of
36 hands or a laser dot, mute the tap sound, or exit.

## Experimental Linux port

An optional Linux implementation is available in [linux/](./linux/README.md):
a GNOME Shell 45–50 companion for Wayland and a Rust X11 app, with visual settings
and per-user installation. GNOME 45–49 are experimental (API/mocks only); 50.1 is
the only desktop-tested version. Settings need GTK 4.8+ and libadwaita 1.4+.
See the compatibility assessment for limits; full macOS parity remains incomplete.

TinyHand's original app, concept, artwork and sounds are by
[Kamran Ahmed (@nilbuild)](https://github.com/nilbuild). The independent Linux
port is maintained by [AbdulRehman56](https://github.com/AbdulRehman56).
See the [Linux guide](./linux/README.md) for installation, packaging and known gaps.
